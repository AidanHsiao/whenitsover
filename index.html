  <p class="title">When its over</p>
  <p>The coronavirus is becoming more and more of a problem as you read this text. Because of a virus' typical exponential nature, the situation will only get worse and worse and worse. Of course, everyone is waiting until it's over. As an introvert, I don't really mind staying inside the entire day. In fact, socially, it's been better for me because I get to contact some of my friends when I'm outside of school, a luxury that I typically don't have. The biggest thing that I can do is play video games the entire day. </p>

  <p style="width:65%;float:right;margin-right:5%">I've always enjoyed playing rhythm games, particularly the ones that I'm good at (because let's be honest no one likes being bad at something). In specific, I'm talking about osu!, which is a rhythm game I'm pretty good at (yes I brought this up for validation lmao)</p>

<p>I've been playing this game for over a year and a half now, and my statistics can be found <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/u/Sweetplum123">here</a>. That basically sums up everything I'd do over the weekends. I've also really enjoyed playing minecraft recently, and started coding a datapack for my friends to use called <strong>classes+</strong>. Classes+ is a datapack that allows people (through me obviously) to create their own anime-style classes in minecraft, and feel like they're actually in some kind of supernatural film. Of course, the entire idea is pretty cheesy, but I enjoyed the process, so I suppose it's a win win.</p>
